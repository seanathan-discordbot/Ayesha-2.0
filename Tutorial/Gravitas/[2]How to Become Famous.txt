Gravitas is gained passively. Every day at 12 a.m. EST, every player's gravitas is adjusted somewhat. Gravitas decays over time. If your character resides in an outlying area of the map (i.e. not in a city), this decay is stronger than if they were in a city. Likewise the more gravitas you have, the more will be lost every night. The smallest change is a 10% loss for players residing in a city with less than 500 gravitas (the largest actually follows one of those complex formulae Ayesha is famous for: `f(x) = x + 500 - (4x/5)`, where x is your current gravitas). But just remember to stay in a city and you will be golden.

The passive gain of gravitas follows.
Farmers gain 4 gravitas daily; soldiers and scribes gain 1; the rest none.
Aramithean born-and-raised also gain 5 gravitas, those from Riverburn or Thenuille gain 3, and players from the Mythic Forest, Lunaris, or Crumidia gain 1.
Members of a college (the association type) gain 7.
The acolytes Ajar and Duchess also give gravitas as their passive effects.

The expedition system (`/travel`) system also rewards those who undertake a campaign throughout the cities to gain a reputation. Those who go on long trips into the middle of the jungle, however, may discover that they have been forgotten about upon their return to civilization. Farmers, fortunately, upon their return, will see that their gravitas income is better than those of other occupations. They get an addition 20% gravitas from urban expeditions, and their decay is halved on wilderness ones.
