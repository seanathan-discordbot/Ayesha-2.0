A tenure as mayor is the highest duty that a man of low-rank (random adventurers in Aramythia) can hope to attain. Once elected, they gain access to the `/tax` command, which allows them to set the tax rate throughout the world. They can also broadcast announcements to players via `/dictate`. At the end of the week, they gain 3% of the tax collected over their mayorship. This may motivate them to set the tax high, but they may also keep it low to keep the favor of their peers.

Fortunately, the people can cast away the tyranny of high taxes by using the `/influence` command. There they can spend their gravitas to praise or insult another player. The mayor who sets their tax rate to 10% may be a target of mass insult, tanking their gravitas, and he who promises to lower it may be praised by others, receiving a boost to their own reputation. The attacks of one person have the possibility to fall flat on their face, but in aggregate, the population wields tremendous power over the reputation of the few.

Thank you for reading! The gravitas system may not be as fleshed out or focused on as other parts of the game, but we are always open to suggestions on expanding it and making it a more integral part of gameplay.
