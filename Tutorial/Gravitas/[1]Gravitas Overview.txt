Something which was not expanded on in the initial tutorial was the gravitas system. It is very simple and exists to bring another dimension of gameplay beyond simply getting physically stronger and/or wealthier. Gravitas, a Roman ideal, is exactly what it sounds like: it is your weight within the world. When you have more gravitas, people care more for what you have to say. In that vein is the officeholding feature. Every Wednesday at 12 p.m. EST, the player with the most gravitas is elected the mayor of Aramithea. The mayor has control over the taxation system, and they have the power to set the tax rate to whatever they please, influencing players' decisions to make sales or purchases. You can view the current mayor using the `/offices` command.

On the next page I will share how to attain gravitas.
