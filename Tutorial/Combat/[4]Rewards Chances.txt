Did you ever see one of the higher levelled players get over 100,000 xp from beating a boss? Did you ever wonder why you got 10,000 xp from beating a boss one time, but only 2,000 when you beat them a second time? The calculation for xp is as follows:
`f(x, y) = 5 * 2^(x/10) * (x+10)^2 * (y + .33)`, where x = the level of the boss, and y = the *percent HP you have remaining* upon victory. So the stronger the boss, the more xp you gain on an *exponential* level, and wider the margin you win by, the more xp you gain. I beg you to appreciate the complex and equitable reward calculation Ayesha has in comparison to other games lol.

Gold calculation is rather unimaginative though, although (history lesson!) it was based off the cosine function in Ayesha 1.0. Now its just a (cringe!) quadratic function.

Upon victory, you also have a flat...
10% chance to gain a weapon
6.67% (1/15) chance to get a piece of armor
5% chance to get an accessory

You can gain none, one, or multiple of these items on any given victory. The [code](https://github.com/seanathan-discordbot/Ayesha-2.0/blob/main/cogs/PvE.py) does not lie. The code is probably bugged, because for some reason, I (Aramythia) never get any armor! >:( The last few pages will give the exact rarities of the drops you may potentially gain.
