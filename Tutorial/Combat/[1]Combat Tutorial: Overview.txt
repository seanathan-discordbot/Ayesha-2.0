Welcome to the Ayesha Combat Tutorial! In the next few pages, I will be divulging into some technical information about the combat system, so if you know nothing about combat or the bot, I suggest you look at the `Quick-Start Guide` instead.

__Some Quick History__
Ayesha was a fairly rushed bot written during the creators' winter break of 2020-2021. Like most of the individual modules, PvE was written in 2 days, but you are not playing that version now ;). When 1.0 was released later that year, Aramythia had written a more robust system that properly integrated acolyte and boss effects, although it was still largely a copy-paste job (and thus poorly integrated next to PvP). A year later, the PvE was rewritten with the rest of the bot into Ayesha 2.0. It is a vast improvement, running on the same foundations as PvP and brotherhood attack, although it was made by a random college student so y'know. Anyway, what this means is that the real tutorial is really in the [code](https://github.com/seanathan-discordbot/Ayesha-2.0), and its details will be found on the next page.
