So now there's a whole of stats, status effects, and that weird turn wizardry that players both old and new will have to understand. If you've played Pokemon (or more accurately Honkai Star Rail ugh), then you'll see some similiarities with Ayesha's combat system.

__Speed__
The speed stat determines the turn order. Obviously higher speed means more turns.
How it works is that all players in combat have a hidden cooldown, initially set to 1000. At each step of combat, this cooldown gets reduced by the player's speed stat until reaches 0. When this happen, the player gets their turn, and the cooldown is reset to 1000. In this system, you'll notice that speed is linear i.e. a player with 50 speed will get twice the turns as a player with 25.

__Armor Penetration__
The other new stat, armor pen will secretly reduce your opponent's DEF by the set amount when you deal damage to them. Normally, if a player throws a 60 damage attack at a player with 50 DEF, the attack will only do 30 damage. If the player has 10% armor pen, however, we can treat the target as having only 45 DEF, so the attack will instead deal 65 damage!

__The Other Stats__
Attack is the basic damage stat, and determines generally how much damage you deal when you attack or thrust.

Crit is a combination of two stats: crit rate and crit damage. Since crit is often denoted by two percentages (`a%/b%`), crit rate is a and crit damage is b. With each attack or thrust, you have a chance to deal a critical strike based on your crit rate. If you do crit, then your damage increase is dictated by your crit damage.

DEF is a percentage of damage reduction and is applied to the calculated damage last.
