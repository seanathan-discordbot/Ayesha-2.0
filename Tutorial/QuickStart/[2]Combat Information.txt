The second page of your profile shows more combat-related information. You have 4 stats, ATK, CRIT, HP, and DEF, which are increased by things such as your level, equipped weapons, armor, accessories and acolytes (you'll see soon!), and your occupation and origin. You can see these equipped items below in the 'Equips' section. Use `/inventory` to see the list of weapons you own, and get the ID of the your 'Wooden Spear' (a number like this: `50000`). Then do `/equip`, select 'Equip a Weapon', select the id option, and type your weapon's ID there. You have equipped your first weapon! When you get armor and accessories in the future, you can find them in the `/inventory` as well and equip them in the same way you equipped your weapon. You can get some types of armor for gold by buying them in the `/shop`, but accessories are attainable only through PvE.
