Welcome to Ayesha! Read the next few pages for a general overview of how to play the game.

If you haven't already, use the `/start` command to create a character. 

The `/profile` command displays basically everything important about yourself. It consists of a couple of pages, with the first 2 being the most important.

Page 1 shows the most essential information about your character. By playing the game over time, you will gain experience and level up your character, all logged in the "Experience" tab on the left.

Next to this tab is your 'Wealth', divided into three parts.
**Gold** is the general currency of the game, used for everything from buying items to selling them.
**Gravitas** is like a measure of reputation in the world. Gravitas is not as important early game and will be covered later.
**Rubidics** are a special currency you use to gain acolytes (also to be explained)!

The next command to use is `/lore`, which allows you to set your occupation and origin. These are just two classes you can set to give you small buffs and debuffs in certain aspects of the game. There are 10 occupations and 9 origins, each giving you a specific bonus based on how you want to play the game."
