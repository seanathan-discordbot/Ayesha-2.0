And now the **REAL** fun part! You have set up your character to the best of your abilities so far, hopefully have a ragtag team of acolytes and a sturdy weapon of your own! The `/pve` command is the core of Ayesha gameplay, the fastest way to gain gold and xp (and hence more rubidics), and the source of armor and accessories.

I suggest you start off with `/pve` level 1 and progress as you beat each level, although you can technically shoot for level 25 right now (I dare you)! Once you beat level 25, you can progress onwards ad infinitum. Each level gets progressively harder, gives more gold and xp, and weapons, armor, and accessories of greater rarity and strength.

When you start, you'll notice 5 buttons:
üó°Ô∏è: Attack - hit the enemy with all you've got!
\N{SHIELD}: Block - a worthy counter to an attack, but 
will leave you vulnerable to...
\N{CROSSED SWORDS}: Parry - a defensive attack; you'll deal 
less damage but also take less damage.
\u2764: Heal - Regain 20% of your max HP
\u23F1: Bide - Give yourself a 15% ATK boost

Against each enemy, you'll need to develop a strategy using these five moves to counter their own strengths. Have fun with Ayesha!
